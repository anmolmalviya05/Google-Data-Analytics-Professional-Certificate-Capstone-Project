# Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate-Capstone-Project
In this , I am going to share my capstone project which I have created after completing Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.
About the course :- The Google data analytics professional certificate (link)is an eight-course certification program offered by Google through Coursera's learning 
platform. It teaches all we need to know in order to land an entry level role in data analytics . Each course dives deep into concepts like working with stakeholders, 
data integrity, preparing data, cleaning data and using advanced programs like SQL and programming language and performing exploratory data analysis and data visualization.

Key learning of this course is to learn the process of performing data analysis. Let's first discuss about the process of data analysis.

The whole process can we summarized in below six steps :-
ASK -Asking effective questions -Defining the scope of the analysis -Defining what success looks like 
PREPARE -Verifying data's integrity -Checking data credibility and reliability -Checking data types -Merge the datasets 
PROCESS -Cleaning, Removing missing values and Transforming data -Document cleaning processes and results 
ANALYZE -Identifying patterns -Drawing conclusions -Making predictions
SHARE -Creating effective visuals -Creating a story for data -Sharing insights to stakeholders

About The Project :-
Introduction :- Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. 
I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, a bike share program based in Chicago. The program has over 5,800 bikes and 600 dock stations.
The company's marketing director is planning to maximize the number of Cyclistic members by creating marketing strategies to convert casual riders to annual member 
riders. Casual riders are customers that purchase single-ride or full-day passes. Cyclistic members are customers that purchase annual memberships. 
As a junior data analyst for Cyclistic, I was tasked to make data-driven recommendations for the marketing campaign. 
I will complete this analysis using the six phases of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.
